Not any more


. .



Barco click sucks by the way.


  Now the real stuff:

    - step 1: do Nothing
    - step 2: try not to do any thing
    - step 3: keep doing nothing
    - step 4: repeate the last three steps
    - step 5: now get some rest
    - step 6: if nothing else can be done go to step 1
    - step 9: if tired stop doing nothing
    - step 10: continue doing nothing
    - step 11: take a one hour break from doing nothing
